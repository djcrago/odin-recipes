Project: Recipes

Showcase my abilities with HTML and basic website building thus far in my programming journey.
Create an HTML boiler plate, links, and ordered and unordered lists.
Include images and alt text for those images.
Ensure code is free of typos and that everything works as intended on the website.
Practice Git commands and commit messages.
After getting the basic idea go back and have more fun with it. Change recipes from real ones off of a website to pretend ones from your favorite video game.
