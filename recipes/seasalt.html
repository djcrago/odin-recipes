        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sea salt ice cream is a salty and sweet popsicle with a sky blue appearance. It was frequently enjoyed over summer break.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 cup milk</li>
            <li>1.5 cup cream</li>
            <li>0.75 cup sugar</li>
            <li>3 tbsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>Teal gel-based food coloring</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together 1 ½ cups each of high quality milk and cream. Combine 3 Tbsp cornstarch in about 1 cup of milk and cream mixture until it is dissolved and no lumps remain.</li>
            <li>Bring the remaining milk and cream mixture close to a simmer on the stovetop. Then, ¾ cup sugar is added directly to the milk and cream on the stovetop until it dissolves over medium-low heat until just simmering. At this point you will add the cornstarch mixture until combined. Let that all cook for about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add one heaping tsp of sea salt to custard on stovetop as it finishes thickening. Then strain into a heat-proof bowl. Add some gel-based teal food coloring.</li>
            <li>Into an ice cream machine it goes for about 25 minutes. </li>
            <li>After that's done, pour into a piping bag in order to cleanly fill popsicle molds. Use stick alignment to assure sticks stand up straight, and in the freezer it goes for at least 6 hours up to overnight. </li>
            <li>Run under hot water to easily take out popsicles and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
